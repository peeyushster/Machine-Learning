Silhouette with squared euclidean distance = -0.2256

Breif explanation on Silhouette evaluation metric-
The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.

Explanation of the results -
Overall Precision, Recall and F-1 measure are all same and equal to 0.4193327329645354. There are a couple of classes for which Precision, Recall and F-1 measure are equal to zero that could occur if classes are rare and are not predicted by classifier.

(b) Results are based on 10% of training data. The model took 50 minutes to get trained on Dumbo
